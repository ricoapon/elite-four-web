### TODO
https://angular.io/guide/deployment#deploy-to-github-pages

GitHub Pages: you can't directly configure the GitHub Pages server, but you can add a 404 page. Copy index.html into 404.html.
It will still be served as the 404 response, but the browser will process that page and load the application properly.
