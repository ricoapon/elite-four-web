<h2>Elite Four</h2>
<p>This program is a tool to help you find your favorite items quickly out of a long list of items. This algorithm
  behind this program is copied from the website Favorite Pokemon Picker (see
  https://www.dragonflycave.com/favorite.html).</p>

<h4>How to use this program</h4>
<p>This tool is based on picking favorites of a list, so in the main screen you are able to add new lists. In each list,
  you can add new items. You can either add them manually or import a file where each line is considered a new items.
  All items are represented as text (single-line). There is no possibility to display it in some other kind of form.</p>

<p>When you have created your list, you can start your algorithm. This way you can find out what items are your
  favorites! Note that when you are in the process of picking items or when you are finished, you cannot edit items in
  the list anymore. If you really want to edit items, you will need to reset all progress ('Reset algorithm').</p>

<p>After you finished your list, you can export the items. You have several options for exporting, click the button to
  see all the options.</p>

<h4>Hotkeys</h4>
<p>If a letter of text inside a button is underlined, that key is the shortcut for that button. When you are entering
  data into a form (for example adding a new list), you can press enter to submit automatically.</p>

<p>On overview screens you can press CTRL+F to show a search box. Typing in this box will filter elements on the
  screen. You can press escape (or CTRL+F again if you didn't select the textbox) to disable search functionality.</p>

<h4>The algorithm explained</h4>
<p>
  Every round you are presented with N choices (configurable, by default 20). You can choose any amount of items
  that you consider better than the other items. The algorithm will mark the other items as "eliminated" by the selected
  items. New choices that are presented to you will not contain any eliminated item. Eventually only one item remains,
  that is the favorite item. All the items that were eliminated by this item, are put back in the pool of selectable
  items. Now you can continue picking until you have chosen your second favorite item, etc. You can stop at any time
  when you are happy with the amount of favorites, but of course you can continue until the whole list has been
  processed.</p>

<h4>The idea behind the algorithm</h4>
<p>When sorting a list using computer algorithms, you always compare two items. Smarter algorithms let you compare less
  items, but in the end you will always compare two items. If you want to sort a list as a human, this would be very
  tedious. To speed up the sorting algorithm where a human does the comparisons, you can show more items at once. In the
  shown set, you can easily say "I like all of these items better than any of those". For a computer this would be a
  lot of comparisons, but for a human this feels fast. The idea of this algorithm is based on this observation.</p>

<p>In the end you will of course need to compare two items: which one really is your favorite? But the algorithm makes
  it so that for a large portion of the choices you can be unspecific. When it really gets down to it, you get less
  items on the screen and you really have to make hard choices. But since you can already make a lot of unspecific
  choices, you will narrow down the list quite fast.</p>

<p>All that picking means is "I like all of these items better than any of those". This is intentionally a
  broad, flexible statement; you'll end up with the same result regardless of how many items you choose to pick from
  each batch, so it's up to you how many you want to pick at a time. If you just want to get your number one favorite or
  a select few, it's quickest to try to pick just one item from each batch, while if you want to construct something
  like a top fifty list, you may want to start by picking every item that's likely to end up in that top fifty.</p>

<p>The elimination mechanic is also why you can't pick nothing. Items can only ever be eliminated by some other
  item, so that the algorithm can know when to bring them back. The "Skip" button is instead equivalent to picking every
  item in the batch, which eliminates nothing and simply means all those items get shuffled into the next round.
  passing over and over won't get you anywhere, so make sure you do some actual picking.</p>

<h4>Algorithm pseudo code</h4>
<p>The algorithm consists of the following loop:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
  <li>The algorithm select (at most) n items which are not eliminated and not a favorite already.</li>
  <li>User selects a set of items.</li>
  <li>The algorithm marks the non-selected items as eliminated by all the selected items.</li>
  <li>Loop while the next selection (step 1) would result in a single item:
    <ul>
      <li>Mark this single item as the next favorite.</li>
      <li>Check all items and remove this favorite from the elimination list.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
